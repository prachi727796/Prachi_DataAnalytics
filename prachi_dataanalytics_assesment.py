Games with higher total engagements may reflect greater audience interest and participation. Games with lower overall engagements, on the other hand, can need more attention or strategic focus to enhance their social performance.


We can discover individual games that may need greater marketing efforts, content optimisation, or other techniques to improve their social performance by looking at the overall engagements for each game title. This analysis can guide decision-making on allocating resources and prioritizing games based on their social performance.

It is possible to determine which media type works better in terms of social interaction by looking at the total engagements for each type of media. Higher levels of audience interest and involvement are indicated by the media type with the highest overall engagements.

Understanding how various media forms, such as videos, photos, and articles, perform in terms of generating social engagement may be learned by analysing the total engagements by media type. This information can help guide decision-making on content creation, marketing strategies, and resource allocation based on the effectiveness of different media types in driving social performance.

"""By grouping the data by the "Campaign Name" column and calculating the sum of total engagements for each campaign, we can determine the social engagement levels of different campaigns. Sorting the results in descending order allows us to identify the campaign with the highest total engagements i.e Community Engagements.

The campaign with the highest total engagements is considered the best performing campaign in terms of social engagement. It indicates a higher level of interest, engagement, or effectiveness in capturing audience attention.

By examining the total engagements for each campaign, we can identify the best performing campaign and gain insights into its success factors. This analysis can guide decision-making regarding campaign strategies, content optimization, and resource allocation to maximize social performance.

# Question 6: Define out a posting strategy for our social channels based on your discoveries.

Based on the discoveries from the dataset analysis, we can define a posting strategy for your social channels. Here are some recommendations based on the insights gained:

Optimal Posting Days: Determine the days of the week that show higher engagement rates. Focus on posting content during these days to maximize audience interaction and reach. Monitor the dataset's analysis of engagement rates by the day of the week and identify the most effective posting days.

Peak Posting Hours: Identify the time of day when engagement rates are higher. Schedule your posts during these peak hours to ensure maximum visibility and engagement. Analyze the dataset's findings on engagement rates by the hour of the day and determine the best posting times.

Emphasize High-Performing Media Types: Identify the media types that perform the best in terms of total engagements. Allocate more resources and focus on creating and promoting content in these high-performing media formats. Refer to the dataset analysis on media type performance to determine the most effective formats for engaging your audience.

Promote Best Performing Campaigns: Identify the best performing campaign based on total engagements. Allocate additional resources and promotional efforts to further enhance the performance of this campaign. Capitalize on its success by creating complementary content, running targeted ads, or leveraging influencers to increase its reach and impact.

Content Optimization: Analyze the dataset to identify patterns and preferences in content that resonates with the audience. Focus on creating content that aligns with these preferences, whether it's specific themes, formats, or messaging styles. Continuously monitor the performance metrics and iterate on content strategies to maximize engagement.

Test and Experiment: Use the dataset analysis as a starting point, but continue to experiment and test different posting strategies. Monitor the performance of your posts, track engagement metrics, and adapt your strategy based on the real-time feedback. Regularly analyze the results and refine your posting strategy accordingly.

Audience Interaction and Engagement: Encourage audience interaction by actively responding to comments, messages, and mentions. Engage with your audience through contests, polls, or user-generated content campaigns. Building a strong relationship with your audience can lead to increased engagement and loyalty.

Performance Tracking and Analytics: Continuously track and measure the performance of your social channels using relevant analytics tools. Monitor key metrics such as engagement rates, reach, click-through rates, and conversions. Regularly review the data and make data-driven decisions to optimize your posting strategy.

Remember that social media strategies should be adaptable and flexible. It's essential to monitor the performance of your social channels, stay updated with the latest trends and changes in your industry, and adjust your strategy as needed to stay relevant and drive optimal results.

#Question 7: What suggestions would you give to the social media team if they want to expand their presence (e.g. if our CSGO youtube channel is doing well should we expand to TikTok)?

Expanding your social media presence can be a strategic move to reach a wider audience and maximize your brand's visibility. Here are some suggestions for the social media team if they want to expand their presence:

Assess Platform Relevance: Evaluate the relevance and suitability of different social media platforms based on your target audience and the nature of your content. Consider factors such as demographics, user behavior, and content format to determine which platforms align well with your goals.

Leverage Successful Channels: If your CSGO YouTube channel is performing well, consider expanding to other platforms that complement video content, such as TikTok. Repurpose or create shorter, engaging clips or highlights from your YouTube channel to cater to the TikTok audience. Capitalize on the success of your YouTube channel and leverage it to grow your presence on other platforms.

Understand Platform Differences: Each social media platform has its own unique features, audience demographics, and content formats. Take the time to understand these differences and adapt your content strategy accordingly. Tailor your content to fit the specific requirements and preferences of each platform while maintaining a consistent brand identity.

Research and Experiment: Conduct thorough research on the platform you are considering expanding to. Understand its user base, content trends, and engagement patterns. Experiment with different types of content and engagement strategies to gauge the response of the audience on that platform. Use analytics and performance metrics to track your progress and make data-driven decisions.

Cross-Promotion and Integration: Cross-promote your presence on different platforms to leverage the existing audience and increase visibility. Promote your TikTok content on your YouTube channel and vice versa. Use social media bio sections and profile descriptions to highlight your presence on other platforms. Encourage your audience to follow you across multiple channels to stay updated on all your content.

Tailor Content to Platform: Customize your content to suit the platform you are expanding to. Each platform has its own content formats, such as short videos on TikTok, visual images on Instagram, or concise updates on Twitter. Adapt your content strategy to fit these formats while staying true to your brand's voice and values.

Engage with the Community: Actively engage with the community on the new platform. Interact with users, respond to comments, and participate in relevant discussions. Building a strong presence and establishing connections with the audience will help grow your following and increase your reach.

Monitor and Evaluate: Continuously monitor the performance of your expanded presence on different platforms. Analyze engagement metrics, follower growth, and audience feedback. Evaluate the impact and return on investment from each platform and adjust your strategies accordingly. Stay agile and responsive to the ever-changing social media landscape.

Expanding your presence to new social media platforms can open up new opportunities and broaden your audience reach. However, it's important to consider your resources, content production capabilities, and the alignment of each platform with your brand identity. Strategic planning, research, experimentation, and data analysis will guide your decision-making process and help you make informed choices when expanding your social media presence.
